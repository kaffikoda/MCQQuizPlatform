**Let'sQuiz** is a mcq platform where users register on the platform and attempt quizzes made by the question setters of the platform to check
their general knowledge.

* There is no restriction on the number of questions to be made for a quiz. The question setters can make as many questions as they want for a quiz.
* They can also see the quizzes published by them.
